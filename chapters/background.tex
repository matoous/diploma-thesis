Usage of AI chat systems.

Siri, Customer Support, etc.

The problems -> no control over what AI says. Maybe some examples of rude AI messages? Like the bot
learned on tweets that tweeted rasistic/nazi messages.

\section{Offensive}

Offensive messages, what falls here, what not.

\section{Sensitive topics}

How it is not just about offensive stuff but some topic might be sensitive "you are adopted", "santa is dead".
Why we can't just forbid some topics (like "abortion is bad" vs "I, very educated person, am not particulary against
abortion but there are positives and negatives, here's what I think, etc.", in other words, it's not about the topic,
it's about the healthiness of the discussion)
